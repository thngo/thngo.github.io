# Project Context: Personal Website

This project is my personal website. The goal is to design, implement, and iterate on it using modern frontend best practices.

## Tech Stack
- React with TypeScript
- Functional components and React hooks
- Modern tooling (e.g., Vite or Next.js, ES2022+)
- Modern browsers only

All examples and implementations should use **TypeScript**, not plain JavaScript.

## Code Quality Expectations
- Clean, readable, maintainable code
- Strong typing with appropriate interfaces and types
- Sensible component composition and separation of concerns
- Avoid deprecated or legacy React patterns (e.g., class components)
- Production-quality code rather than tutorial-style snippets

## Design & UX Principles
- Clean, minimal, professional aesthetic
- Developer-oriented personal brand
- Responsive by default (mobile-first)
- Accessibility-aware (semantic HTML, ARIA when appropriate)
- Reasonable defaults for typography, spacing, and layout

## Collaboration Preferences
- Propose component structure and folder organization when helpful
- Explain reasoning behind architectural or design decisions
- Proactively suggest improvements, refactors, or best practices
- Ask clarifying questions only when they materially affect the solution

## Assumptions
Unless stated otherwise, you may assume:
- The site is mostly static (home, about, projects, blog, contact)
- SEO and performance matter
- The code should be suitable for real-world deployment

## Constraints
- Avoid JavaScript-only examples unless explicitly requested
- Avoid unnecessary overengineering
- Prefer clarity and maintainability over cleverness
